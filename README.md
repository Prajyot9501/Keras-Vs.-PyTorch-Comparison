# Keras-Vs.-PyTorch-Comparison
Just an experimental Python file to compare models offered by Keras and PyTorch

# Description

This project aims to explore and compare the capabilities, syntax, and performance of two leading deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch, using the classic MNIST handwritten digit recognition task as a benchmark.

The MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, serves as an excellent platform for benchmarking machine learning models. In this notebook, we delve into creating and training neural network models to classify these digits, first using TensorFlow/Keras and then replicating the same model architecture using PyTorch.

## Key aspects covered include:
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Model architecture design and implementation in both frameworks.
- Training and evaluation of models.
- Comparison of accuracy, performance, and ease of use between TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.


With a detailed walkthrough, this project not only highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each framework but also serves as a practical guide for those looking to understand or choose between TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch for their projects.

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
